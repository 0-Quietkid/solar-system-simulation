A very simple simulation of the solar system with all the eight planets and the sun at it's centre.
The simulation is made using the actual mass and radius values of the planets and the sun to ensure accuracy, 
whatever the user sees is a sped up version because the solar system is so large one would think the planets are not moving at all, 
but that is obviously not the case.
The simulation runs based of pygame and has very simple three commands, pause that happens when the key P is pressed, 
zoom in and out that happens using the mousewheel and finally quit that happens by closing the window.
The simulation shows the exact x and y co ordinates of the planets so one can see where they will be in real time and how it evolves over time.
Using it is very simple just run the code and pygame will open a window on your computer, hopefully you will enjoy using the simulation and it will
be made more complex in future by adding a starry background, asteroid and keyper belt etc.
